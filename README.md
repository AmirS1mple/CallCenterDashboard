# Call Center Dashboard

In this Excel dashboard project I cleaned, created pivot tables and finally created an interactive dashboard. This Excel file also contains 12 columns.

This file include 5 worksheets for gathering insights abbout call centers. These are Sentiment, Response time, State, Date of calls and Reason. The last part is my interactive dashboard. Lets get dig in.




### Sentiment
This pivot table shows us numbers of tickets based on feeling of people who made contact. I used bar char rather than column chart because this chart shows data better.

### Response time
This pivot table shows us duration of response to a  user. This is measured by 3 factors. Below SLA, within SLA and Above SLA. For this section I used a normal column chart.

### State
This pivot table shows number of ctickets per state which give us a great insight in a geographically way.

### Date of calls
This one tells us how many tickets call centers had on a specific date. For this table I  used a line chart.

### Reason
The last pivot is to gathe insight about in what channel people made contact and where were they from. I used a bar chart to know all reasons all at once.

### Dashboard
Dashboard itself contains all 5 charts and 5 slicers which contains call center, channel, state, reason and sentiment. With thhese slicers you can easily saw what happened when you interact with slicers. You can find all in the Excel file.
